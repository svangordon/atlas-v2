* Earth Engine trainings from this workshop are available on this website (see navbar above).

## Resources

The following are helpful (and important!) Earth Engine resources.

* Earth Engine Explorer: The Earth Engine explorer provides a way to visualize, discover,
and interact with datasets, all without using any code. Not all datasets can be visualized
in the explorer, but all can be discovered. If you sign in to the explorer (by clicking the
sign-in button on the upper right), it is even possible to do some classification in the
explorer.

* Developer Documentation: Earth Engine has documentation to help developers. This covers
a range of topics, and should be your first stop if you are trying to figure out how to
do something or resolve an error.

* Help Forum: The help forum is a place where users can ask questions, share resources,
and stay up to date about Earth Engine. You can access it by clicking the 'Help' button
in the upper right and selecting 'Help forum'. (You will have to make an account). This is
a great place to find help with an error, or to seek expert guidance. Many people will
post their scripts here. When I am undertaking a new project, it is a great idea to search
for ideas here: often, I find that someone has created an excellent solution to my problem,
and I only need to take the script that they have posted and adapt it for my needs.

* Training Resources: Earth Engine has a number of resources available for training others
on Earth Engine. These examples are intended more for training users of the product who already
have a remote sensing background:

There are also resources that are developed for more of a university setting:
